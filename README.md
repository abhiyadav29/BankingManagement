# BankingManagement

This is a console-based Banking Management System written in C++ using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.
It allows users to create, deposit, withdraw, check balance, display, and delete bank accounts in an interactive, menu-driven way — without file handling.

All account data is stored temporarily in memory using STL vectors (resets when program closes).
This project is designed to demonstrate clean code, modularity, and core OOP concepts.
